This is a pair of programs that translate between NWChem movecs files
in the usual binary format and an ASCII form that can be moved to
another platform and converted back into a binary file for that
machine.  They are quite simple, and don't do much error checking, but
they seem to work.

Requires NWChem's include files and libnwcutil.a containing the MA
library.


MA_USE_ARMCI_MEM must not be set to anything for this to work:
unsetenv MA_USE_ARMCI_MEM

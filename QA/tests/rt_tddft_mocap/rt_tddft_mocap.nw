#
# Delta-function kick simulation on a water molecule
# using a molecular orbital complex absorbing potential
# (MO CAP) to remove the high virtual states.
#
# The basis here is far too small to get a continuum falloff,
# this gives you the basic idea.
#
# For comparison, you might want to run with the MO CAP turned off.

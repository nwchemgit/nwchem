          Convergence Information
          -----------------------
          Convergence aids based upon iterative change in 
          total energy or number of iterations. 
          Levelshifting, if invoked, occurs when the 
          HOMO/LUMO gap drops below (HL_TOL):  1.00D-02
          DIIS, if invoked, will attempt to extrapolate 
          using up to (NFOCK): 10 stored Fock matrices.

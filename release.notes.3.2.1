Release Notes for NWChem version 3.2.1 

NWChem Known Bugs in version 3.2.1

* Texas integrals do not function properly on the CRAY T3E.  

* Properties module does not work with spherical basis sets.

Previous NWChem Known Bugs in version 3.2

* This is fixed in version 3.2.1. MP2 gradients: MP2 gradients are
known to give wrong results.

* Direct MP2 optimizations: MP2 optimizations that are performed with
the direct option can have problems with CPHF convergence.  In this
case, the user is advised to use the default options which is a
semi-direct calculation.  It is always best to use the default
algorithms and parameters in NWChem, until they do not work for your
particular case.  Machine specific changes to the defaults are
continually being added to NWChem.

* Texas integrals with high angular momentum and large exponents: This
is fixed in version 3.2.1.  There were multiple instabilities found in
various recursions in the algorithms used in the Texas integral code
(and in many other codes).  All but one has been resolved.  NWChem now
checks for the possibility of this last instability and automatically
turns the Texas integral code off when necessary.  User's should not
turn off the Texas integral code by default (except on the T3E).  In
3.2, integrals that were calculated using the Texas integral package
had errors when calculating integrals with high angular momentum and
large exponents.  This showed up, for example, when the cc-pVTZ basis
set has been used.


* Message mismatch or job hanging: These messages will occasionally be
observed on NWMPP1 especially when running CCSD calculations.  These
are errors that happen sporadically and are being worked on.  If you
experience either of these problems, please send your bug report using
the correct channel listed in the Reporting Problems with NWChem page.
This will help us in the determination of the problem.  Note that the
message mismatch is generally found in the MPL version of NWChem on
NWMPP1 and the job hanging is generally found in the LAPI version.  If
you experience a problem with one version, you might want to try the
other version.  On NWMPP1, the binaries are:

/u/nwchem/bin/nwchem -> LAPI version
/u/nwchem/bin/nwchem.mpl -> MPL version 

* start, restart, and continue in the title:  When the words start,
restart, and continue appear at the beginning of the title, NWChem
erroneously picks them up when scanning for start, restart, and
continue directives.  The work around is to not use these words at the
beginning of the title.


* CCSD(T) energies are unstable on the IBMSP: CCSD(T) energies are
unstable on the IBMSP using either the LAPI or the MPL version.  Error
that the user will see are ga_mismatch or jobs that just hang.  We are
working with IBM to solve this problem.

  http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/mscf/training/tutorial/index.html

* How do I get a better initial Hessian than the default diagonal or
  internal hessian for an optimization?
  The easiest method is to calculate a Hessian at a lower level of
  theory and basis set and then read that Hessian in for the geometry
  optimization.  The key to doing this is to include INHESS 1 in
  DRIVER or STEPPER.  An example of how to do this is:

--- example start --------------------------------------------------------------
start h2o_optimization

title; H2O optimization using a better initial Hessian

geometry units angstroms
  O       0.0  0.0  0.0
  H       0.0  0.0  1.0
  H       0.0  1.0  0.0
end

basis
  H library sto-3g
  O library sto-3g
end

scf
  print low
end

task scf freq

basis
  H library 6-31g**
  O library 6-31g**
end

driver
  inhess 1
  print medium
end

task scf optimize
--- example end ----------------------------------------------------------------

* I am having problems getting my initial guess correct when I use
  ECPs.  What can I do to get good starting orbitals?
 -The atomic initial guess currently does not work correctly in all
  cases with the presence of ECPs.  A good method to use is
  independently converging fragments with ECPs.  More details on how
  to do this can be found in the User's Manual.
  http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/docs/nwchem/doc/user/index.html
 -Remember that you can (and SHOULD!) look at your initial orbitals by
  putting the line: 
	print "initial vectors"
  into the SCF block of your input deck.  If the order isn't correct,
  you can use the "swap" directive to change the order of the
  orbitals.  For example:
	vectors atomic swap 173 175 174 176 output end.movecs
  will cause the orbitals 173 - 175 to be swapped to 175, 176, 173 and
  174.  Note that the swaps are pairwise: first 173 and 175 are
  swapped, then the the current orbitals 174 and 176 are swapped.
  More information on initial orbitals can be obtained in the User's
  Manual.

Changes additions to functionality in NWChem (from the CVS log
 information)

* More robust QA test cases (Courtesy of our users and in particular
  Dave Feller and John Nicholas; Thanks guys!)

* Java Reporting tool developed by Danielle Farrar went into
  production.  This tool is for use by all EMSL users/Collaborators 
  and the specific point of contact at our distributed sites.  It
  requires Java 1.1.x and allows users to browse for input, output,
  and error files that are attached to the email sent to the support
  staff.  This eliminates "cutting" and "pasting" of this information.

* "nqenw" a tool to submit jobs to NQE specific to NERSC.  Operates like
  "llnw" on NWMPP1 at EMSL.

* modifications were made to default DFT parameters for more
  robust/stable operation and energies/gradients.

* new input style "lst" for geometries added. 
  See http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/docs/nwchem/doc/user/index.html

* Several basis sets and ECPs (including large and small core
  Stuttgart) where added to the NWChem library.
 
* bug in frozen core determination in MP2 was fixed. 

* an integrated preparation module "prepar" for the MD code was
  included.  This eliminates the necessity for nwtop, nwrst, nwsgm in
  previous releases of NWChem. 

* Job Identification numbers for NQE and LoadLeveler are now reported
  in the NWChem output file.

* The integral API was modified to pre-determine if the last Texas
  instability exists in a given basis set and turns Texas integrals
  off if necessary. The Texas integral interface now uses better logic
  for determining whether to use Texas 93 or Texas 95 routes.

* Default Integral accuracy for radial cutoff in the API was tightened. 
  (standard 10**-15, high 10**-30)
 
* The integral API was extended to handle the required functionality
  for periodic DFT gradients.

* default NWChem integral settings now handle spherical basis sets but
  not general contractions.
 
* Fixed normalization for fitting style basis functions for DFT/RI methods.

* Spin Orbit integrals and integral API routines were added.

* Basis Set Object was modified to read Spin-Orbit specifications

* Basis Set Object can now write basis set information to the Ecce
  output file.
 
* LAPI and SP1 are now separate targets and builds for the IBMSP systems.

* ChemIO updated to latest revision from Dr. J. Nieplocha 

* DFT weight derivatives bug was fixed.

  >

* Geometry object knows how to print distances/angles/dihedral angles
  based on atomic radii.

* Geometry object can now auto-detect and use symmetry when requested
  via the autosym keyword.  This is still experimental but functional.

* Accuracy of SCF Energies/Gradients now consistent.

* integration of "NBO" directly into NWChem.  You must have a license
  from the University of Wisconsin, Madison for NBO to use this
  functionality.

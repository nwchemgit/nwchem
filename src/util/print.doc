Print control
-------------

All modules should use the same print control mechanism to provide
both uniformity and flexibility.  The routine in util_print do this.

A) All modules understand the print levels

   none
   low
   medium = default
   high
   debug

   "None" is defined to mean literally no output except for
catastrophic errors (e.g., inconsistent data, failure to converge).

B) Printing of specific quantities may be directly enabled or
   disabled from the input.

C) Modules operate independently and printing will eventually be
   controllable via context

This is how it currently works.

Inside the SCF input

  print low basis "final eigenvectors"
  noprint title

This sets the overall SCF printlevel to low, forces printing of the
final eigenvectors and basis, and disables printing of the title.

------------

The implementation is very simple.  Each module defines one or two
entries in the database which enable/disable printing

  <module>:print ... list of names to enable print
  <module>:noprint ... list of names to disable print

The special values (none, low, ...) are recognized in the list of
print keywords and are used to adjust the print level.
The parsing of this list is encapsulated in the routine
util_print_rtdb_load().  To support multiple modules a stack of print
options is maintained ... this will eventually be combined with the
context.

The code necessary for each module is then simply

  In the input routine

     Upon detecting a line with the print directive 

     call util_print_input(rtdb, "module_name")

  At the beginning of a module

     call util_print_push 
     call util_print_rtdb_load(rtdb, "module_name")

     Util_print_push() sets the default printlevel for a new module.
     Util_print_rtdb_load reads in any input parameters

  To control printing within a module

     #include "util.fh"

     if (util_print("name", level)) then
       write out data associated with "name"
     endif

     Level is one of the prespecified print levels 
     (print_none, print_low, ...) or some module specific value
     (see util/printlevels.fh for actual values).  

     If (  (the level is below the current printlevel and printing of
            "name" has not been explicitly disabled)
           or
           (the printing of name has been explicitly enabled) )

        util_print returns .true.
     endif
         
  At the end of a module

     call util_print_pop

  E.g.

      #include "util.fh"

      call util_print_push
      call util_print_rtdb_load('scf')

      if (util_print('information', print_low)) then
         write(6,*) ...
      endif

      ...

      call util_print_pop

If an application wants more direct control over printing there are
routines to explicitly control the print level and to enable/disable
printing of named items.

util.fh has been modified to define the integers

    print_none     = 0 (use of this will force printing even if none
                        is asked for!)
    print_low      = 10
    print_medium   = 20
    print_high     = 30
    print_debug    = 100
    print_never    = 1,000,000
    print_default  = print_medium

and the routine

    logical function util_print(name, level)
    character*(*) name
    integer level   

Other relevant routines are

    subroutine util_print_push
    subroutine util_print_pop
    subroutine util_print_set_level(level)
    subroutine util_print_input(rtdb, prefix)
    subroutine util_print_rtdb_load(rtdb, prefix)

These two routines are probably not needed by applications

    subroutine util_print_enable(name)
    subroutine util_print_disable(name)

files need to be changed for sphericals and symmetry:
sym_bas_op.F
	: added logical argument for transformation
	: added sym_bas_op_spherical to transform to spherical basis functions
sym_bs_irrep.F
	: added argument/logic for spherical
sym_mo_ap_op.F
	: added argument/logic for spherical
sym_sym.F
	: added argument/logic for spherical
sym_vec_sym.F
	: added argument/logic for spherical
makefile
	: if dgemm is used add sym_bas_op to USES_BLAS

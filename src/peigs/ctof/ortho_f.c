       FORTRAN wrapper for ortho.

       This subroutine computes the infinity-norm measure:
       
       ort = max_i | (Z^t.Z)_i - I_i | / ULP,

       for the standard symmetric eigensystem problem where

         Z is N-by-M
         I is M-by-M.
         Z_i is an eigenvector,
         (Z^t.Z)_i is the i-th column of Z^t.Z
         I_i is the i-th column of the m-by-m identity matrix
         ULP = (machine precision) * (machine base)
         |.| is the infinity-norm.

       res is reasonable if it is of order about 50 or less.


       MUST have M <= N.  If M > N then program exits.
       This is not a limitation of this subroutine as M > N
       implies the columns of Z are linearly dependent, which
       implies "ort" will always be large in this case.

       
       on input:
       
       n    = (input) Integer
              1st dimension of the matrix Z

       m    = (input) Integer
              2nd dimension of the matrix Z

       matZ =(input) double precision
             colZ[i] points to the start of the ith column of Z OWNED
             by this processor.
       
       mapZ = (input) integer array of length m
              mapZ[i] is  the id of the processor owning column i of Z.
       
       iwork = (Workspace) Integer array of length 
       work  = (Workspace) DoublePrecision array of length 
       
       OUTPUT:

       ort   = (Output) DoublePrecision
               ort as defined in equation above, but only if
               info = 0.  
       
       info  = (Output) Integer
               = 0  if this processor is in mapZ
               = -1 if this processor is NOT in mapZ, in which case
                    ort is undefined on exit.

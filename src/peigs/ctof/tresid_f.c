       FORTRAN wrapper for tresid().

       this subroutine computes the residual
       
       res = max_{i} | T z_{i} - \lambda_{i} z_{i} |/( | T | * ulp )
       
       where T is an n-by-n  tridiagonal matrix,
        ( \lambda_{i} , z_{i} ) is a standard eigen-pair, and
       ULP = (machine precision) * (machine base)
       
       |T| is the 1-norm of T
       |T z_{i} .... | is the infinity-norm
       res is reasonable if it is of order about 50 or less.
       
   Arguments
   ---------
       
       n = (input) dimension of the matrix T
       m = (input) number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors

       d(1:n) = (input) diagonal of T

       e(1)   = junk
       e(2:n) = (input) sub-diagonal of T
                        = super-diagonal of T

       colZ = (input) DoublePrecision eigenvectors in packed storage
       mapZ = (input) integer array of length m holding the id of the processors
                      holding the eigenvectors in colZ.
       eval = (input ) array of m DoublePrecision eigenvalues
       
       iwork = (workspace) array of Integer workspace
       work = (workspace) array of DoublePrecision workspace
       
       res  = (output ) the residual described above.

       info = (output ) = 0, then everything ok
                        < 0, then -info-th input variable is not valid

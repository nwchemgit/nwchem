    This routine performs an element by element comparision of a
    length n array of characters, data, on a processor with its
    neighbor as described by a list of processors proclist[0:nprocs-1].
    
    n ........... number of bytes of data in array data

    *data ....... pointer to char (char *)
                  character array with n elements which should be the
                  same on all processors in proclist

    *nprocs ...... number of processor ids in proclist

    *proclist ... pointer to Integer (Integer *)
                  a list of 'nprocs' processor ids on which 'data' should be
                  the same.

                  There must be no repeated processor ids in proclist
   
    iwork ....... pointer to Integer (Integer *)
                  workspace of length at least n bytes, i.e., the same
                  size as data
 
    msg1 ........ pointer to char (char *)
                  General error message, e.g. "Error in pdspevx"

    msg2 ........ pointer to char (char *)
                  Specific error message indicating what data represents
                  so can tell user what data differs on different
                  processors

    *info = 0:  'data' on this processor is the same as 'data' on
                one of this processor's neighbors.

          = 1:  'data' on this processor is different from 'data' on
                one of this processor's neighbors.  *info = 1 on one
                processor does not mean that *info != 0 on all processors
                in proclist.  To do this you need to do a global operation.
                This is typically by pgexit().

                The processors on which *info = 1 print an error message
                to stderr

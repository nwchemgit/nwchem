    This routine performs a global check on an integer n: if n is negative
    on any processor in procmap the routine exits with a message from array.
    n should be less than or equal to 0 on all processors in procmap.
    
    a global combine is performed on n.
    if n is less than 0 upon return, a exit is called.
    
    It is assumed that values in the array map[0:len-1] form the same set
    of processors (User Beware); for this routine, the ordering in map[0:len-1]
    is not important.
    
    if n is not 0 after a global combine then all processors in procmap
    set *n = -51, print the error message in "array", plus a statement
    indicating that info = -51 and exits.

   This subroutine computes the infinity-norm measure:
       
   ort = max_i | (Z^t.Z)_i - I_i | / ULP,

   for the standard symmetric eigensystem problem where

     Z is N-by-M
     I is M-by-M.
     Z_i is an eigenvector,
     (Z^t.Z)_i is the i-th column of Z^t.Z
     I_i is the i-th column of the m-by-m identity matrix
     ULP = (machine precision) * (machine base)
     |.| is the infinity-norm.

   res is reasonable if it is of order about 50 or less.


   MUST have M <= N.  If M > N then program exits.
   This is not a limitation of this subroutine as M > N
   implies the columns of Z are linearly dependent, which
   implies "ort" will always be large in this case.

   Arguments
   ---------
   In the following:

     INTEGER          = "pointer to Integer"
     DOUBLE PRECISION = "pointer to DoublePrecision"

     me     = this processor's id (= mxmynd_())
     nprocs = number of allocated processors ( = mxnprc_())
     nvecsZ = number of entries in mapZ equal to me
                  (= count_list( me, mapZ, m ))
     nvecsZ_max = maximum number of entries in mapZ equal to i,
                  i = 0 to nprocs-1
                  (= max over i of count_list( i, mapZ, m ))
     sDP    = sizeof( DoublePrecision )

       
   n....... (input) INTEGER
            Number of rows in Z

   m....... (input) INTEGER
            number of columns in Z (i.e., # of 
            eigenvalues/eigenvectors).
            Must have m <= n.

   colZ ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                    length (nvecsZ)
            The part of matrix Z owned by this processer, stored
            in packed format, i.e., colZ[i] points to the start
            of the i-th column of matrix Z owned by this
            processor, i = 0 to nvecsZ-1.
                
   mapZ ... (input) INTEGER array, length (m)
            The i-th column of matrix Z is owned by processor
            mapZ[i], i = 0 to m-1.

   ibuffptr (workspace) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                        length(nvecsZ)

   iwork... (workspace) INTEGER array, length( 7 * m )

   work.... (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
                        length( nvecsZ * n + maximum( d_mxm25,
                                                      mxlbuf_() / sDP + 1 )
                        where d_mxm25 = maximum ( 2*m, (nvecsZ + 2*nvecsZ_max)*n )
       
   ort..... (output) INTEGER
            the residual described above.

   info.... (output) INTEGER
            = 0, not currently used

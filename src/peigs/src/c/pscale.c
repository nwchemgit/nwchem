   *  Parallel version of LAPACK's DSTEBZ.
   *
   *  This routine is directly callable from both FORTRAN and C.
   *  The documentation below always uses FORTRAN array indexing,
   *  i.e., 1 to N, rather then C array indexing, i.e.,  0 to N-1.
   *  This should be kept in mind when calling this routine from C.
   *  Also when calling this routine from C 
   *    INTEGER (array)           means "pointer to Integer" and
 *    DOUBLE PREICISION (array) means "pointer to DoublePrecision"
 *
 *
 *  Purpose
 *  =======
 *
 *  PSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
 *  matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
 *  in the half-open interval (LB, UB], or the JJJLB-th through JJJUB-th
 *  eigenvalues.
 *
 *  To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
 *  largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) *
 *  underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
 *  accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.
 *
 *  See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
 *  Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
 *  University, July 21, 1966.
 *
 *  Arguments
 *  =========
 *
 *
 *  JOB     (input) INTEGER
 *          = 1  : ("All")   all eigenvalues will be found.
 *          = 2  : ("Value") all eigenvalues in the half-open interval
 *                           (LB, UB] will be found.
 *          = 3  : ("Index") the JJJLB-th through JJJUB-th eigenvalues (of the
 *                           entire matrix) will be found.
 *
 *  N       (input) INTEGER
 *          The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.
 *
 *  LB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
 *  UB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
 *          If JOB=2, the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
 *          be searched for eigenvalues.  Eigenvalues less than or equal
 *          to LB, or greater than UB, will not be returned.  LB < UB.
 *          Not referenced if JOB = 1 or 3.
 *
 *  JJJLB   (input) INTEGER
 *  JJJUB   (input) INTEGER
 *          If JOB=3, the indices (in ascending order) of the
 *          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
 *          1 <= JJJLB <= JJJUB <= N, if N > 0.
 *          Not referenced if JOB = 1 or 2.
 *
 *  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
 *          The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
 *          (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
 *          determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
 *          less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
 *          will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.
 *
 *          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
 *          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
 *
 *  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
 *          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
 *
 *  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
 *          The first element of E, E(1), is junk, the rest of E, E(2:N),
 *          contains the (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal
 *          matrix T.
 *
 *  MAPZ    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 *          A list of the ids of the processors which are to participate
 *          in the eigenvalue computation.
 *
 *  NEIGVAL (output) INTEGER
 *          The actual number of eigenvalues found. 0 <= NEIGVAL <= N.
 *
 *  NSPLIT  (output) INTEGER
 *          The number of diagonal blocks in the matrix T.
 *          1 <= NSPLIT <= N.
 *
 *  EVAL    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
 *          On exit, the first NEIGVAL elements of EVAL will contain the
 *          eigenvalues.  (PSTEBZ may use the remaining N-NEIGVAL elements as
 *          workspace.)
 *          The eigenvalues will be grouped by split-off block (see IBLOCK,
 *          ISPLIT) and ordered from smallest to largest within the block.
 *
 *  IBLOCK  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 *          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
 *          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
 *          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
 *          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue EVAL(i)
 *          belongs.  (DSTEBZ may use the remaining N-NEIGVAL elements as
 *          workspace.)
 *
 *  ISPLIT  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 *          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
 *          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
 *          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
 *          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
 *          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
 *          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
 *          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
 *          have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)
 *
 *  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( )
 *
 *  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension ( )
 *
 *  INFO    (output) INTEGER
 *
 *          PSTEBZ attempts to return the same INFO on all processors in MAPZ.
 *          Currently, however, if the input data is invalid, -50 < INFO < 0,
 *          then INFO will be different on different processors.
 *
 *          = 0:   successful exit
 *
 *          < 0 &
 *          > -50: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
 *
 *          = -51: Then the input data was not the same on all processors in MAPZ
 *
 *          > 0:   some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
 *                 were not computed, or they were computed incorrectly:
 *
 *                 =1: routine DSTEBZ3 returned a non-zero info.  Meaning
 *                     that on one or more processors some or all of the
 *                     eigenvalues failed to converge or were not computed
 *                     In this case the processor with a non-zero info from
 *                     DSETBZ3 prints and error message to stderr.
 *
 *                 =2: NSPLIT and/or ISPLIT were not the same on all processors
 *
 *                 =3: Relative processor i computed an eigenvalue larger than
 *                     the smallest eigenvalue computed by relative processor i+1
 *                     for some i.  This should not occur using the current algorithms.
 *
 *                 =4: The number of eigenvalues found in a block of T is bigger
 *                     then the dimension of the block.
 *
 *             
 *               In theory INFO = 2, 3, or 4 should never occur.  If they do occur
 *               then DSTEBZ3 failed to correctly compute the requested eigenvalues.
 *
 *               Note that DSTEBZ3 is a modification of LAPACK's DSTEBZ.  The
 *               modifications had to be made to avoid gettings INFOs like 3 and 4.

 bug fixed with new lapack code

in this version of broadcast, we are broadcasting to a list of

all duplicate node ids are removed so that we have a
minimal set of processors doing the pipelining

buf         = (input/char) this is the buffer that is to
                 be broadcasted ( should move to untyped)

len          = (input/integer) this is the size, in bytes,
                  of the buffer

type        = (input/integer) type for the message type

root         = (input/integer) the root id

k_indx   = (input/integer) length of the list in map

map        = (input/integer array) is a ptr to the
beginning of a
list of processor.  Typically this is the
locations of the columns/rows
		     of the matrices
		     
scratch   = (integer scratch array) length(k_indx + 1)

/**************************************************************
 *
 * Subroutine mxm25
 *
   This subroutine does the matrix multiplication Z <- Q*W
       
   where matrix Q is a n1 x n2 general matrix in packed storage format,
         distributed by rows,

         matrix W is a general n2 x m matrix in packed storage format,
         distributed by columns.

         and matrix Z is the n1 x m product Q*W, distributed the same as W.
       
   In this version we assume that Q and W share the same processors
   ( perhaps different data distributions )

   It is ok to have colZ = colW.  However, in this
   case each colZ[i]=colW[i] must point to a vector of
   length = MAX{ n1, n2 }.

   ARGUMENTS
   ---------
   In the following:

     INTEGER          = "pointer to Integer"
     DOUBLE PRECISION = "pointer to DoublePrecision"

     me     = this processor's id (= mxmynd_())
     nprocs = number of allocated processors ( = mxnprc_())
     nvecsW = number of entries in mapW equal to me
                  (= count_list( me, mapW, m ))
     nvecsQ = number of entries in mapQ equal to me
                  (= count_list( me, mapQ, n1 ))
     nvecsQ_max = maximum number of entries in mapQ equal to i,
                  i = 0 to nprocs-1
                  (= max over i of count_list( i, mapQ, n1 ))
     sDP    = sizeof( DoublePrecision )

   n1 ..... (input) INTEGER
            The number of rows in matrix Q

   n2 ..... (input) INTEGER
            The number of columns in matrix Q
            and the number of rows in matrix W

   rowQ ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                    length (nvecsQ)
            The part of matrix Q owned by this processer stored
            in packed format, i.e., rowQ[i] points to the start
            of the i-th row of Q
            owned by this processor, i = 0 to nvecsQ-1.
                
   mapQ ... (input) INTEGER array, length (n1)
            The i-th row of Q is owned by processor
            mapQ[i], i = 0 to n1-1.

   m ...... (input) INTEGER
            The number of columns in W.
       
   colW ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                           length (nvecsW)

            The part of matrix W owned by this processer stored
            in packed format by columns, i.e., colW[i] points
            to the first element of the i-th column of W
            owned by this processor, i = 0 to nvecsW-1.
                
   mapW ... (input) INTEGER array, length (m)
            The i-th column of W is 
            owned by processor mapW[i], i = 0 to m-1.
                
   colZ ... (output) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                     length (nvecsW)

             The result matrix Z = Q * W stored identical to W.

             It is ok to have colZ = colW.  However, in this
             case each colZ[i]=colW[i] must point to a vector of
             length = MAX{ n1, n2 }.

   iwork .. (workspace) INTEGER array, length ( 3 * n1 + 2 * m )

   work ... (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, 
                        length ( maximum ( n1 + m, (nvecsW + 2 * nvecsQ_max) * n2 )

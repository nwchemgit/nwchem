     DOUBLE PRECISION = "pointer to DoublePrecision"

     sDP    = sizeof( DoublePrecision )

       
   n....... (input) INTEGER
            size of the matrix A

   colA ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                    length (nvecsA)
            The part of matrix A owned by this processer stored
            in packed format, i.e., colA[i] points to the diagonal
            element of the i-th column (or equivalently row) of A
            owned by this processor, i = 0 to nvecsA-1.
                
   mapA ... (input) INTEGER array, length (n)
            The i-th column (or equivalently row) of A is 
            owned by processor mapA[i], i = 0 to n-1.

   norm ... (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
            The one-norm of A

   iwork... (workspace) INTEGER array, length( n+nvecsA )

   work.... (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
                        length( n + 1 + mxlbuf_() / sDP + 1 )
       
   info.... (output) INTEGER
            = 0, not currently used

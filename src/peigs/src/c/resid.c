   A is an n-by-n symmetric matrix, in packed storage format,

   |A z_{i} ... | is the infinity-norm,

                    length (nvecsA)
            The part of matrix A owned by this processer stored
            in packed format, i.e., colA[i] points to the diagonal
            element of the i-th column (or equivalently row) of A
            owned by this processor, i = 0 to nvecsA-1.
                
   mapA ... (input) INTEGER array, length (n)

            number of columns of Z, i.e. # of eigenvalues/eigenvectors

   colZ ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                    length (nvecsZ)
            The part of matrix Z owned by this processer, stored
            in packed format, i.e., colZ[i] points to the start
            of the i-th column of matrix Z owned by this
            processor, i = 0 to nvecsZ-1.
                
   mapZ ... (input) INTEGER array, length (m)
            The i-th column of matrix Z is owned by processor

   iwork... (workspace) INTEGER array, 
                        length( m + maximum( nprocs, n+nvecsA, i_mxm88 ))
                        where i_mxm88 = 2*(n+m)+nvecsA+nvecsZ

                        where d_mxm88 = maximum ( (nvecsZ+1)*n, mxlbuf_()/sDP + 1 )
       
   res..... (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
            the residual described above.

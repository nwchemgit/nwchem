/*
  
  PeIGS internal routine.  This is used in the one processor case.
  The user should be warned of possible communication hang in the
  multiprocessor case if there's not enough buffer space.
  
  
  Let U be any upper triangular matrix. Let L be a lower triangular matrix.
  This subroutine solves the upper-triangular part of Y for the matrix
  problem
  
  L Y = U
  
  The resulting upper-triangular part of matrix Y overwrites U.
  
  The matrix U is row wrapped.
  The resulting matrix Y overwrites the matrix U.
  The matrix L is column wrapped.

   This subroutine computes the  infinity-norm measure:
       
   ort = max_i | (Z^t.B.Z)_i - I_i | / ULP,

   for the generalized symmetric eigensystem problem where

     Z is N-by-M and distributed by columns
     B is N-by-N symmetric and in packed storage
     I is M-by-M.
     Z_i is an eigenvector,
     (Z^t.B.Z)_i is the i-th column of Z^t.B.Z
     I_i is the i-th column of the m-by-m identity matrix
     ULP = (machine precision) * (machine base)
     |.| is the infinity-norm.

   res is reasonable if it is of order about 50 or less.
       
   MUST have M <= N.  If M > N then program exits.
   This is not a limitation of this subroutine as M > N
   implies the columns of Z are linearly dependent, which
   implies "ort" will always be large in this case.

   Arguments
   ---------
   In the following:

     INTEGER          = "pointer to Integer"
     DOUBLE PRECISION = "pointer to DoublePrecision"

     nvecsZ = number of entries in mapZ equal to me
                  (= count_list( me, mapZ, n ))

                  i = 0 to nprocs-1

                    length (nvecsB)
            The part of matrix B owned by this processer stored
            in packed format, i.e., colB[i] points to the diagonal
            element of the i-th column (or equivalently row) of B
            owned by this processor, i = 0 to nvecsB-1.
                
   mapB ... (input) INTEGER array, length (n)

            owned by processor mapB[i], i = 0 to n-1.

   m....... (input) INTEGER
            number of columns in Z (i.e., # of 
            eigenvalues/eigenvectors).
            Must have m <= n.

   colZ ... (input) array of pointers to DoublePrecision,
                    length (nvecsZ)
            The part of matrix Z owned by this processer, stored
            in packed format, i.e., colZ[i] points to the start
            of the i-th column of matrix Z owned by this
            processor, i = 0 to nvecsZ-1.

                        length( n+m + MAX{nprocs, 3*n+2*m+nvecsB+nvecsZ }

   work.... (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
                        length( nvecsZ * (n+m) + maximum( d_mxm25, d_mxm88,

   ort..... (output) INTEGER
            the residual described above.

   info.... (output) INTEGER
            = 0, not currently used

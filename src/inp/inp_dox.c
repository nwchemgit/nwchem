\brief Notes on the input parsing routines

The input parser processes the user's input file and translates the
information into a form meaningful to the main program and the driver routines
for specific tasks.  The parser translates input following the 
rules for free-format input specified in the NWChem Users Manual.  The
following sections present detailed descriptions of the functions
used by the input parser, and the conventional form of the processed
input.

All input routines must be declared in the header file `inp.fh`.
